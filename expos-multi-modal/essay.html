		<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>            “The World Relies on
			One Chip Maker in Taiwan, Leaving Everyone Vulnerable” says a Wall Street
			Journal headline. “The World Is Dangerously Dependent on Taiwan for
			Semiconductors” says a Bloomberg headline. “Cold war 2.0 will be a race for
			semiconductors, not arms” says a Guardian headline. China has been trying to catch
			up in its technology to be able to manufacture leading edge semiconductors.
			Combined with a pandemic supply chain shortage, this has made the US realize its
			reliance on foreign manufacturing. The Biden administration’s Chips and Science
			Act passed last year, giving funding for companies to build new factories in
			America, has been the first major step in their attempts to bring semiconductor
			production back. As semiconductors continue to be the foundation of all
			technology, commercial and military, politicians have been scrambling to take
			control of the industry. </p>

		<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>            But wait a second. Just
			eight years ago, sitting in an elementary school history class in Taipei, I was
			told we were a small, humble island nation of 23 million people. Our economy
			was based on manufacturing. We had no Apples or Facebooks. But everything from
			cheap toys to bikes carried the “Made in Taiwan” label. I was told we weren’t allowed
			to officially be part of the global community. We weren’t recognized as a
			country, excluded from the UN and WHO, and we couldn’t do much about it without
			provoking a war. Amidst all this, how did this island, always overshadowed by
			the geopolitical field of China, become this crucial to such an important
			modern technology? And why is it suddenly the US’s obsession?</p>

		<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>            Producing
			semiconductors is extremely hard. The field requires expensive research and
			development, and the rate of technological improvement creates fierce
			competition. Famously illustrated by the questionably accurate Moore’s “Law,”
			being a couple years ahead makes all the difference in this exponentially
			advancing industry. The supply chain of manufacturing these semiconductors is
			characterized by the phases of design, fabrication, packaging, and testing.
			Shaken up by the pandemic shortages and Chinese advancements in the industry,
			everyone is concerned about the prevalence and crucial link of Taiwan in that
			supply chain. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) fabricates 92% of
			high-end chips and 56% of revenue share in the fabrication market, not to
			mention other Taiwanese companies in various steps of the supply chain (Jie et
			al.). </p>

		<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>            Only 40 years ago,
			Taiwan had a primarily agricultural and factory assembly-based economy. Still
			developing its economy, Taiwan had to find valuable and highly technical
			industries to get into for world-class products that could make it a more
			stable and significant player in the global economy (“How Taiwan Created TSMC”).
			Looking for ways to advance its economy, the Taiwanese government employed a
			more decentralized, competitive approach to researching new industries that
			differed from the centralized and isolated efforts in a few big tech firms like
			in Korea and Japan. In 1973, the government set up the Industrial Technology
			Research Institute (ITRI) to target R&amp;D projects that would spin-off into
			countless small companies with different expertise and high competition from
			both domestic and global markets (“How Taiwan Created TSMC”; Feigenbaum 6~7).
			By 1985, ITRI had successfully taken its firsts steps in bringing Taiwan into
			tech, but the country remained far behind the leading edge. This was when Taiwanese
			Texas Instruments’ senior vice executive Morris Chang went back to Taiwan after
			the government offered him to lead ITRI. At the time, the still young, less
			complicated, and less competitive semiconductor industry only consisted of
			traditional Integrated Device Manufacturers (IDMs), vertically integrated
			companies like Intel that designed and fabricated their own chips from start to
			finish (Mark Liu 318). But with it becoming increasingly hard to have both
			successful leading-edge chip designs and leading-edge manufacturing, IDMs began
			to have high lead times and limited room for growth. Taiwan, at that point,
			already had a strong assembly manufacturing base and a cheap, expanding talent
			pool but weak Intellectual Property strength, sales, and marketing sectors.
			Taking that into account, the only good option Chang saw was a new business
			model: the pure-play foundry (318). He created TSMC as a fabrication only firm
			that would dedicate all its resources into the best manufacturing technology
			while only taking in customer designs. TSMC could focus purely on doing the
			best manufacturing without relying on successful designs to fill its factories.
			After a few years, the model became a success, coinciding with the rise of
			fabless firms, companies that only designed chips without having to invest into
			expensive and complicated manufacturing. TSMC was a platform of manufacturing, adapting
			and serving customers as it specialized in perfecting its specific foundry
			process.</p>

		<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>            Today, TSMC’s
			prominence as the main supplier of high-end chips has become a hugely political
			contention. Especially after the pandemic chip shortages, everyone has been
			scrambling to find alternatives to the potential bottleneck of relying on one
			geopolitically contested country for the supply of such a crucial technology.
			In <i>Do Artifacts Have Politics, </i>Langdon Winner examines the framework in
			which to evaluate an innovation’s political impacts that helps explain the
			situation of the foundry model. In the essay, Winner separates their impacts
			into two broad categories of those that arise from a particular group or
			society’s use of a technology and technologies that inherently require certain
			political paradigms. He argues that fully evaluating technological innovations
			requires us to answer the question: “does this state of affairs derive from an
			unavoidable social response to intractable properties in the [innovations]
			themselves, or is it instead a pattern imposed independently by a governing
			body, ruling class, or some other social or cultural institution to further its
			own purposes?” (Winner 131). In order to understand TSMC’s prominence and how
			the US wants to retain control in the industry, we’ll have to first answer what
			parts of the foundry model are inherent political tendencies of the technology
			and what factors depend on the context it is used in?</p>

		<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>            Winner’s most confident
			example for inherent politics in technologies is plutonium recycling in nuclear
			energy. With its requirement of centralized investment and “sacrifice of civil
			liberties” regarding the safety of nuclear materials and technologies, he
			quotes Russell W. Ayres that proliferation of plutonium recycling technology
			will bring about “’pressure to eliminate the traditional checks the courts and
			legislatures place on the activities of the executive and to develop a powerful
			central authority better able to enforce strict safeguards’” (134). Looking at
			the foundry model, its capital intensive, horizontally integrated nature has
			led to a centralization of the process. This explains the prominence and
			reliance on Taiwanese semiconductors and the high entry barrier. But the rest
			of the supply chain, which is also capital intensive, has horizontally
			integrated along with fabrication, creating a specialized global supply chain
			that has benefited under free trade. For example, TSMC relies on machines only
			produced by Dutch company ASML while US companies dominate chip design. This is
			to say, the technology’s complexity and capital intensity inherently make highly
			specialized firms more competitive and dominate their respective process. So, when
			the Wall Street Journal headline says the world relies on one chip maker, “Making
			Everyone Vulnerable,” so is the world reliant on one machine manufacture, a
			handful of chip designers from the same country, and a handful of mineral
			suppliers, “Making Everyone Vulnerable.”</p>

		<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>            At the same time, there
			were key political motivations and circumstances in Taiwan that made the foundry
			model’s success possible. This would constitute an impact from “Forms of
			Order,” where “many technical devices and systems important in everyday life
			contain possibilities for many different ways of ordering human activity,” and
			thus the way the technology is treated changes the trajectory of its impact (Winner
			127). It was the specific combination of a strong manufacturing base, lack of sales,
			marketing, and IP strength, and need for Taiwan to develop more technical
			industries that prompted Morris Chang to create the foundry model (Mark Liu 318).
			Furthermore, besides the government making a bit less than half of the initial
			investment into TSMC, it was largely left on its own. The government’s decentralized
			strategy towards investment gave plenty of room for startups and small firms to
			compete and adapt to each other and the global market (Feigenbaum 7).</p>

		<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>            Inherently vertically
			separated and conducive of free trade while birthed in an environment of
			competitive development, the foundry model’s political characteristics gives a
			general explanation to the status quo. But the importance of semiconductors for
			national security, as most modern military technologies rely on chips, has
			prompted governments to rethink the paradigm created by the foundry model. For
			China and the West, they’re answer has been to move towards independent
			production or regionalization. Using embargoes and industrial policy such as
			the CHIPS act to separate production into parallel markets (Lin 5). But in
			order to create many regionalized foundry markets that are as effective as
			Taiwan’s, is it as easy as throwing billions into building factories on
			American or Chinese soil? If Taiwan’s politics have already proven a layer of unique
			circumstances that fostered the model’s success, digging deeper into other factors
			might tell us more about how the unassuming country got to where it is and what
			the US needs to understand about the industry.</p>

		<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>            Looking at less obvious
			fields, another of Taiwan’s exports that has had outward impact and
			geo-political implications is its music. As an article from USC’s US-China
			Institute explains, walking in China’s big cities in the early 2000s, “the
			artists dominating the airwaves [were] not from the Chinese mainland” (Liu and
			Song). Listed on Baidu, 12 of the top 25 singles of 2007 in China were Taiwanese,
			and another seven were from Hong Kong or Singapore (Liu). Starting from the
			mid-80s when China began allowing Taiwanese music in the mainland, artists like
			Deng Lijun followed by A-Mei were able to bridge the cultural and political gap
			to create music that all Chinese speakers could resonate with. After them, new
			artists like Jay Chou, Wang Leehom, JJ Lin, Rainie Yang and groups like MAYDAY,
			S.H.E., and Shin each brought their distinctive voices to a greater Chinese audience.
			Yet again, this small country managed to create something that penetrated and flourished
			beyond expectations. It did so in the most populous country in the world, and a
			mortal enemy at that. </p>

		<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>            Putting this through
			the lens of Winner’s framework of inherent and structural politics of
			artifacts. Taiwanese music from the 80s to 2000s was a fresh and developing
			field, influenced by strong structural factors. Across the Taiwan Strait, the
			Chinese government still restricted outside cultural influences and closely
			overlooked its domestic scene. Despite a period of strict martial law after the
			Nationalists escaped to the island in 1949, Taiwan was having its rapid
			development, becoming a part of the world economy, and eventually democratizing.
			Taiwan’s structural politics built a perfect cultural backdrop for entrepreneurship
			and new ideas. Taiwanese arts and culture were able to draw from Western and
			Japanese influences to develop a diverse, mature scene of its own (Liu and
			Song). This was key to Taiwan’s musical success in China. Deng Lijun brought in
			a mix of traditional and contemporary love songs, Jay Chou brought mandarin
			into the realms of R&amp;B, and MAYDAY introduced China to rock while students
			in China felt their local artist to be “still conservative” (Liu and Song). A
			culture of openness and entrepreneurship was deeply intertwined with the
			development of the Taiwanese music industry and is fundamental to the Taiwanese
			identity. Understanding that unlocks another aspect of the foundry business
			that can’t be explained on balance sheets.</p>

		<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>            As important as political
			policy and capital expenditure are, the foundry model’s global presence has
			been equally shaped by Taiwan’s culture. A decentralized and open entrepreneurial
			spirit allowed for the now bustling tech sector to first emerge. That’s a harder
			thing to say for a developing China, for example, where the government actively
			wants its successful businessmen to fear them, like in the case of the sudden
			disappearance of Jack Ma after commenting on some policies at a panel. But coming
			from a small developing country, Taiwan’s entrepreneurship also came with a
			humble receptiveness, ready to adapt and serve market needs as efficiently and
			cheaply as possible. After all, what those history classrooms taught was to humbly
			adapt and make the most out of the circumstances we were given, lest not to disturb
			a sensitive paradigm, political or not. Despite doing pioneering work,
			Taiwanese entrepreneurs weren’t necessarily setting out to create or disrupt
			new markets. To illustrate this receptiveness and adaptation, the main player
			left from the age of IDMs is Intel, which, despite its world-class talent,
			still struggles to compete with the combination of foundry and fabless firms
			that TSMC has brought around. During a recent panel, Morris Chang quotes
			Taiwanese CEO of NVIDIA, Jenson Huang, to explain the difference: “TSMC has
			learned to dance with 400 customers; Intel has always danced alone” (Chang
			1:40). Being receptive, collaborative, yet entrepreneurial has defined what a
			platform company like TSMC should be like, and it is inextricably linked to a
			certain Taiwanese cultural mindset. It even translates into work culture. In
			the same panel, Chang describes the difference between Taiwanese and American technicians
			where, when a plant breaks down at 1am, it will be fixed at 9am the next
			morning in the US while a technician in Taiwan would be in there fixing by 2am
			(“How Taiwan Created TSMC” 8:15). What makes this even more critical is how the
			talent gap is becoming the top concern and bottleneck for the industry’s
			development (Lin 4). Whether it’s a receptive entrepreneurial spirit, or a
			certain work culture, there is more than just politics at play here.</p>

		<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>            With the geopolitical
			circumstances the US is trying to deal with, it must be conscious of how its
			approach will change the trajectory and structural politics of the foundry
			model. It must understand that a mix of political and cultural circumstances
			allowed the foundry model to thrive under a division of labor and free trade
			where each country specializes in what they’re best at yet relies on each other
			to bring about the pervasiveness of chips we see today. The US is not Taiwan,
			neither is China, nor the Netherlands, Korea, or Japan. Embargoes and onshoring
			of plants in the US already threaten to raise the costs of chips (Lin 5). With
			our current trajectory, Morris Chang already exclaimed that “in the chip
			sector, globalization is dead” (Chang 3:51). But the semiconductor industry as
			we know it cannot function alone. The degree to which US officials want to
			follow China into an arms race for chips and the degree to which it wants to do
			it alone is up to them.</p>
