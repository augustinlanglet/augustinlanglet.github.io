            <h1>What You’re Hearing:</h1>
            <p><a href="https://youtu.be/zjVb4eEUBDE" target="_blank">君在前哨</a> (Jun Zai Qian Xiao) is a song by Taiwanese singer 鄧麗君 (Teresa Teng), the first of many Taiwanese singers to gain a substantial audience in mainland China and the rest of East Asia. The song was written in 1981 during her visits to many Taiwanese military bases, singing for soldiers to boost moral. The song is dedicated to soldiers at the front lines and the longing of women back home. 鄧麗君 took on the nickname of 軍中情人 (the army’s lover).</p>
            <p>Every year, China continues to ramp up its <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/02/chinas-warplane-incursions-into-taiwan-air-defence-zone-doubled-in-2022" target="_blank"> intrusions into Taiwanese airspace.</a> Taiwan’s air force has to continuously send planes to quickly intercept and keep Chinese planes out of its airspace. For citizens living in cities and towns around Air Force bases, continuous sounds of the air force’s fleet of F16Vs have become a fact of life.</p>
