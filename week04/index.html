            As a photographer, I found the first episode very provocative. I wrote an essay last semester just on authenticity in visual mediums, focusing on photos. I feel like the way we see, use, and value photography is changing fast enough for our perceptions of their authenticity to adapt in ways traditional art cannot. In his time, Berger thought traditional arts had a sense of authenticity and value over photography because of its physical values. But I think modern photography has grown in its own ways too.

            A few other noteworthy parts I found was the way oil painting was inextricable linked to ownership and wealth and how it grew to break free from that in some ways, which begs the question of what true art is meant for and how socio-economic factors play into that.
