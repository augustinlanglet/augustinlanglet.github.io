        It’s really interesting to see how the very very early inventors of modern computing 
        envisioned the technology as they were just stumbling upon it.

        In some ways, the mindsets they have when approach such revolutionary technology seems to be something we ought to study in terms of understanding how we might want to approach modern technological inventions. These ideas of the Memex machine were foreign to them, but I can see them embedded in so many technologies and ways we think nowadays from cameras to watches.

        It just amazes me to think there was a time where people and technology didn’t think this way. Because I feel like everything from the concept of file structures or annotations like metadata are engrained in how digital natives like me think.
