                                I think the most interesting part of the article was about how the author thinks about net.art or internet art in relation to the traditional art, especially physical arts (with her sculptures). I still feel like the convention in the art and how art is experienced still sees physical art as the more credible, authentic, or valuable form of art. And I think how we value art depending on if it lives on the internet or physically plays out in a similar way in a lot of other areas. The main one that comes to mind rn to me is Gen Zâ€™s obsession with film over digital.
